# Custom Popup Design

Here is the demo: https://livebloggerofficial.github.io/custom-popup-design/

Once you click on the close button, the popup will not appear again. If you want to test it again, then you have to delete the key popupDisplayed from the localstorage of the browser.

In Chrome, you can go to developer tools -> Application -> Local Storage and delete the key from there.
